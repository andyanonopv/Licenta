## üîß How It Works

### Task Creation Flow:
1. User creates a task via `TaskController@store`
2. Task is saved to database
3. `TaskNotificationService::notifyTaskCreated()` is called
4. All project team members (except creator) receive email notification
5. Assigned user receives notification (if different from creator)

### Task Update Flow:
1. User updates a task via `TaskController@update` or `TaskController@updateStatus`
2. Original task data is captured before update
3. Task is updated in database
4. `TaskNotificationService::notifyTaskUpdated()` is called with original data
5. Changes are tracked and formatted
6. All project team members (except updater) receive email with change details

### Team Member Addition Flow:
1. User adds team member via `ProjectController@addMember`
2. Member is added to project
3. `TaskNotificationService::notifyTeamMemberAdded()` is called
4. All existing team members receive notification about new member
